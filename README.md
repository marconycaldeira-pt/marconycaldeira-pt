:wave: Hello! I've been buliding things since I was a kid. I love hardware tweaking and prime numbers - they are just so intriguing. Got my first Raspberry Pi in high school, since then my collection is increasing by every fall. In October 2019, I started a programming club in my college, [@hackclubnmit](https://github.com/hackclub-nmit) with the support of [@hackclub](https://hackclub.com/). You should definitely check it out. I've always been fascinated with programming, trying to learn as much as possible considering myself :spades: jack of all trades. I try to stick by this one-liner - *Implementing Science Fiction*. Besides programming I enjoy :swimmer: swimming, :video_game: gaming and :badminton: professional badminton.
